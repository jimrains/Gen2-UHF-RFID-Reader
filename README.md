# Gen2 UHF RFID Reader with Successive Select Function
This is a fork from work by N. Kargas, followed by A. Laurie. The purpose of this fork is to add a successive select functionality in order to address individual RFID tags prior to forcing all tags to generate a preamble at once. It is very important to make software available to the public when engaging in research, particularly for peer review purposes.
